# Text-classification
In this exercise 3 types of neural networks very popular in text classification are implemented: deep neural network, a convolutional network with n-grams and an LSTM network.
Definitions taken from wiki are used as input text, which are classified into 4 categories: animals, people, objects, and places.
The performance of each network in the classification is evaluated by observing the accuracy graphs of the set of train and test.
Finally the models are tested with a new text to compare.
